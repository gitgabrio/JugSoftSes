Demo application for the JUGAncona

It consist of two activity, a plain old tcp server, and a tcp client.

The main view holds two button: the first one open a "Choose contact" dialog, while the second one open the ServerView activity.
The ServerView activity has an handler and, at the onCreate method, set up the server class, giving it its Handler; then, start the server thread.
When the server receives some text from a connection, it send it back to the ServerView activity, using the handler.
Last, when the application is at the Main activity, flipping it (horizontal or vertical) will create a connection to the server running on another device
and will send it the current orientation.

About setting up:

1) start the first emulator, and put the application in server mode
2) telnet the first emulator, and setup redir:
	redir add tcp:12345:12345
3) start the second emulator, and simulate rotation with CTRL+F12 (Fn+CMD+F12 on Mac).

That's all, folks!
